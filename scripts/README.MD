User Stories

As a user:
I can add different bookmarks to my bookmarkslist. These boookmarks contain:
        -title (required)
        -url link (required)
        -description (optional)
        -rating(1-5 optional)

I can see the list of the bookmarks I have created when I open the app.
        -All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

I can click on a bookmark to view the expanded view.
        -Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
